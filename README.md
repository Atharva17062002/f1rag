# F1GPT - A RAG-based Conversational AI

F1GPT is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application that leverages **OpenAI API**, **Astra DB**, and **Next.js** to provide dynamic and contextually relevant answers from a rich knowledge base. It combines the power of generative AI with a robust retrieval mechanism to enhance responses with factual data from custom datasets.

## üöÄ Features
- **OpenAI API** for generating natural language responses.
- **Astra DB** (Cassandra-based) as a scalable, cloud-native NoSQL database for storing and retrieving documents.
- **Next.js** for building a responsive, fast, and SEO-friendly frontend.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for improving response accuracy by grounding the model's output with real-world data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Next.js** - React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **OpenAI API** - For generating conversational responses.
- **Astra DB** - Managed Cassandra database for storing indexed documents.
- **LangChain** - To orchestrate the RAG pipeline.
- **Pinecone** or **Weaviate** (optional) - For vector-based document retrieval.

## üß© How It Works
1. **User Query:** A user submits a query through the F1GPT frontend.
2. **Document Retrieval:** The query is matched against the document index stored in Astra DB.
3. **Augmented Query:** Relevant documents are retrieved and passed as context to the OpenAI API.
4. **Response Generation:** The OpenAI API generates a response grounded in the retrieved documents.
5. **Final Output:** The user receives an accurate and contextual response.
